## What is Guitario?
Guitario is a simple guitar note practice app, designed to help anyone practice playing all of the notes on the fretboard of a guitar. Currently the mobile version(s) of the app don't support any pitch detection and can't automatically tell you if you are playing the right note or not because of some limitations with React Native, but those features are being worked on and will hopefully work at some point soon.

## Installation/Viewing Instructions

### Web
To use Guitario on the web (which is the most complete version) simply go [here](https://brandon205.github.io/doto/).

### Android
Simply go to the Releases tab of this github repository and download the latest release .apk file. This should end up in your downloads folder on your phone and you can run the APK and it will install onto your device.
If there is an update that you would like to download it do NOT delete the app, instead go download the new latest file, go to your downloads and run it. From there the app will automatically update and the new version should be right where the old one was.

### IOS
Currently there isn't a way to get Guitario on IOS, but future updates could allow that to happen!

## How to use Guitario

### Web
The Web version is the most complete and has pitch detection so that you can play a note and have it test to see whether you played it right or not. To do that click on the Start button and it will use your microphone to listen and see what note/pitch you are playing, if you play the note that is on the screen then a new note will generate.  
If you don't want to use the microphone features then you can simply use the app like normal as explained below ing the Mobile section.

### Mobile
Currently the sound recognition and Pitch detection systems are not working on mobile so the app doesn't have those features, however it does still have everything else including Note practice and the String Note practice modes.  
Note Practice is on the front page right when you load up the app, to use it simply play the Note on the String that it shows and then tap on the Note/String text to get a new Note and String to play, keep repeating this for more practice. If you get stuck on a note you can tap on the Stuck? button to see the fret that you need to play..
